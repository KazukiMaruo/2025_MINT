## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to:
- Explore electrophysiological representation (= EEG) of numerosity in infants.
- Explore the cross-modality (auditory vs. visual).


## Steps for Reproducibility

This section outlines the pipeline, with step-by-step explanations of how to set up the experiment.

### 1. Download the experiment repository. 
- **Option 1**: Clone via Git (Recommended)

ã€€If you have Git installed, open your terminal and run the following command:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
  cd your-repo-name
  ```

- **Option 2**: Download as a Zip file 

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization**: Use plots (histograms, scatter plots) to explore relationships between variables.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlations.
