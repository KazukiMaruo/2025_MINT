# Protocol for the experiment

## Overview

This repository contains numerosity stimuli and outlines the steps for the stimuli generation. The goal is to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and clarity of the experiment for all.

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to:
- Explore electrophysiological representation (= EEG) of numerosity in infants.
- Explore the cross-modality (auditory vs. visual).


## Workflow

This section outlines the pipeline, with step-by-step explanations of how the experiment is generalized.

### 1. Stimuli generation
- **Auditory**: download the 'audio folder'
- **Visual**: use 'visualstimuli_generator.py' 
- **Cacthy Video**: download the 'catch folder'

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization**: Use plots (histograms, scatter plots) to explore relationships between variables.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlations.
